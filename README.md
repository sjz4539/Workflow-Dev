Workflow is meant to be a way to track your to-do list and relevant resources (files, web pages, notes, etc) across multiple devices, originally conceived to help me when swapping between my PC and Android tablet.

Basic concept: Creates a library in some commonly-accessible storage (eg Dropbox), uses that location to store copies of all tracked resources and task information so it can be accessed by other instances of itself. You choose the library's root folder and where to store file resources within that structure, so if you already have your stuff organized, you can keep that structure within your library (you'd have to recreate it one resource at a time for now, no mass import function exists yet).

This offers the advantage of providing a central access point to your files with task-oriented visual organization, so it's just a matter of choosing what to work on rather than finding the things related to what you want to do (which is kind of a pain on Android). The task-based overlay also allows things like due dates, descriptions, notes, etc to be paired with resource groups.

Brushed the cobwebs off this project to get some Android development work in. It's a little bit disorganized; I'm trying to get Eclipse and Android Studio to play nicely together while using the same git repo, so I'm stuck with AS's kind of irritating project structure and all these empty folders.

This project isn't really at a nice, clean spot for branching and all yet, either, so there'll be a lot of changes right on master until all the major gaps get filled in.
