Brushed the cobwebs off this project to get some Android development work in. It's a little bit disorganized; I'm trying to get Eclipse and Android Studio to play nicely together while using the same git repo, so I'm stuck with AS's kind of irritating project structure and all these empty folders.

This project isn't really at a nice, clean spot for branching and all yet, either, so there'll be a lot of changes right on master until all the major gaps get filled in.
